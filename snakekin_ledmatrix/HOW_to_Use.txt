1) create a folder called snakekin_ledmatrix
2) move the files: snakekin_ledmatrix.ino, LedTestAnimation.h, LedMatrixTypes.h, LedMatrixMethods.h
into the folder
3) open in Arduino IDE

Note theres 2 matrices;
LedMatrix = 7x8 = byte array of 7 items. Each bit of each array item represents an LED
ApplesMatrix = 7x8 byte array of 7 items. Each bit of each array item represents an LED
